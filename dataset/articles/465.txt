Epidiolex is a brand-name prescription drug. It’s used to treat seizures caused by two forms of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. These rare but severe conditions usually appear in early childhood or infancy. Epidiolex contains the drug cannabidiol (CBD). It comes as a liquid solution that’s taken by mouth. Epidiolex is approved for use in adults and children ages 2 and older. In clinical studies, Epidiolex reduced the number of seizures in people taking the drug. During these studies, most people were taking Epidiolex in combination with at least two other epilepsy drugs. The studies showed that: people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who were taking Epidiolex had 20% to 25% fewer seizures than people not taking the drug, people with Dravet syndrome who were taking Epidiolex had 26% fewer seizures than people not taking the drug. Epidiolex was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2018. It was the first drug approved to treat Dravet syndrome. Epidiolex contains cannabidiol (CBD), which comes from marijuana (cannabis). Epidiolex is the first FDA-approved drug made from cannabis. You may wonder if Epidiolex will act like marijuana in your or your child’s body. Marijuana contains two main drugs: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). These drugs have different effects on the body. THC can make you feel “ high ” or euphoric. CBD doesn’t make you feel that way. Epidiolex contains only CBD. It doesn’t contain any THC. Yes, Epidiolex is a controlled substance. This means it can cause dependence, and its use is regulated by the federal government. Epidiolex is classified as a schedule five (V) prescription drug. Drugs with a higher classification (such as schedule five drugs) have a lower risk of being misused than drugs with a lower classification (such as schedule one drugs). This means that Epidiolex has a low risk of being misused. Epidiolex is available only as a brand-name medication. It’s not currently available in generic form. Epidiolex contains the active ingredient cannabidiol. As with all medications, the cost of Epidiolex can vary. To find current prices for Epidiolex in your area, check out WellRx. com.

The following list contains some of the key side effects that may occur while taking Epidiolex. This list does not include all possible side effects. For more information on the possible side effects of Epidiolex, or tips on how to deal with a troubling side effect, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. The more common side effects of Epidiolex can include: fatigue (lack of energy), drowsiness, feeling weak, malaise (generally not feeling well), loss of appetite, diarrhea, skin rash, insomnia (trouble sleeping), infections (such as viral or fungal infections). Most of these side effects may go away within a few days or a couple of weeks. If they’re more severe or don’t go away, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Serious side effects from Epidiolex aren’t common, but they can occur. Call your doctor right away if you have serious side effects. Call 911 if your symptoms feel life-threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency. Serious side effects, explained in more detail below in “ Side effect details, ” include the following: liver problems, sedation (sleepiness, loss of coordination, and trouble thinking clearly), severe allergic reaction, suicidal thoughts or behavior. You may wonder how often certain side effects occur with this drug. Here’s some detail on certain side effects this drug may cause. Allergic reactionAs with most drugs, some people can have an allergic reaction after taking Epidiolex. Symptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include: skin rash, itchiness, flushing (warmth and redness in your skin). A more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include: angioedema (swelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet), trouble breathing. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has a severe allergic reaction to Epidiolex. Call 911 if your symptoms feel life-threatening or if you think you’re having a medical emergency. DrowsinessDrowsiness was a common side effect in people taking Epidiolex during clinical studies. Up to 25% of people taking the drug felt unusually sleepy. During clinical trials, about 12% of people taking Epidiolex had fatigue (low energy levels). And between 3% and 6% of people taking the drug felt sedated during clinical studies. Symptoms of sedation can include: sleepiness, loss of coordination, trouble thinking clearly, being unable to safely operate equipment or machinery (such as driving a car). People taking higher doses of Epidiolex felt drowsy, fatigued, or sedated more often than people taking lower doses of Epidiolex. Talk with your doctor if you or your child has any of these side effects after taking Epidiolex. They may need to change your dose or have you try a different medication. Avoid using machinery (such as driving a car) while taking Epidiolex until you know how the drug will affect you. Sleep problemsIn clinical studies, between 5% and 11% of people taking Epidiolex had the following sleep problems: insomnia (trouble falling asleep or staying asleep), poor quality of sleep, sleep disruption. Sleep problems were more common in people taking lower doses of Epidiolex than in people taking higher doses of the drug. If you or your child has trouble sleeping while using Epidiolex, talk with your doctor about ways to improve your sleep. DiarrheaIn clinical studies, between 9% and 20% of people who took Epidiolex had diarrhea. People taking higher doses of Epidiolex had diarrhea more often than people taking lower doses of the drug. If you or your child has diarrhea while using Epidiolex, talk with your doctor. They can recommend ways to help relieve this side effect. Liver damageLiver damage has occurred in people taking Epidiolex. In clinical studies, almost 16% of people taking the drug had high blood levels of liver enzymes. High levels of liver enzymes in the blood can mean there is a problem with the liver. Symptoms of liver problems can include: nausea, vomiting, pain in your upper abdomen (belly), fatigue (lack of energy), loss of appetite, jaundice (yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes), dark-colored urine. In clinical studies, people taking higher doses of Epidiolex had liver problems more often than people taking lower doses of the drug. Liver damage was the most common reason for people stopping use of Epidiolex during clinical studies. If you have liver disease, you may have a higher risk of having liver damage while taking Epidiolex. Be sure to review your medical history with your doctor before starting Epidiolex. Your doctor may test your liver function before and during your Epidiolex treatment. If you develop liver damage during treatment, you may need to stop taking the drug. Let your doctor know if you have any symptoms of liver problems during your treatment with Epidiolex. Suicidal thoughts and behaviorEpidiolex and other anti-epilepsy medications can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Other medications used to treat epilepsy (anti-epilepsy drugs) also increase this risk. An analysis by the FDA looked at several studies done in people using anti-epilepsy drugs. Eleven different drugs were studied. This analysis found that people treated for epilepsy had an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. The risk in people taking anti-epilepsy drugs was 80% higher than the risk in people who were not taking these drugs. The risk was increased after just one week of taking the medications. These studies were done before Epidiolex became available. It’s not known for sure how often people taking Epidiolex have suicidal thoughts or behavior. During treatment with Epidiolex, your doctor will monitor you or your child closely for signs of new or worsening depression or unusual mood changes. Talk with your doctor right away if you notice these signs in yourself or your child, or if you have thoughts of harming yourself. If you know someone at immediate risk of self-harm, suicide, or hurting another person:, Call 911 or the local emergency number. Stay with the person until professional help arrives. Remove any weapons, medications, or other potentially harmful objects. Listen to the person without judgment. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, a prevention hotline can help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 1-800-273-8255. . Weight lossWeight loss was reported during clinical studies of Epidiolex. People taking higher doses of Epidiolex noticed more weight loss than people taking lower doses. After almost four months of treatment: 18% of people taking 20 mg/kg of Epidiolex per day lost at least 5% of their body weight, 9% of people taking 10 mg/kg of Epidiolex per day lost at least 5% of their body weight. Loss of appetite is a possible side effect of Epidiolex. Between 16% and 22% of people taking Epidiolex had decreased appetite during clinical studies. Weight loss in people taking Epidiolex could result from lack of appetite. If you’re concerned about weight loss while taking Epidiolex, talk with your doctor about ways to help you or your child maintain a healthy weight. The Epidiolex dosage your doctor prescribes will depend on several factors. These include: your or your child’s weight, the severity of the condition you’re using Epidiolex to treat, your or your child’s liver function, other medications you or your child are taking. Typically, your doctor will start you or your child on a low dosage and adjust it over time to reach the dosage that works best. They’ll ultimately prescribe the smallest dosage that provides the desired effect. The following information describes dosages that are commonly used or recommended. However, be sure to take the dosage your doctor prescribes. Your doctor will determine the best dosage to suit your or your child’s needs. Epidiolex comes as a strawberry-flavored liquid solution that’s taken by mouth. It’s available in a 100-mL bottle. Each mL of Epidiolex solution contains 100 mg of active drug. You or your child will take the liquid solution using a plastic oral syringe. You use this device to measure the amount of medication, and to release the solution into your or your child’s mouth. This drug can be taken using a 1-mL or a 5-mL syringe. Your pharmacist will give you the right-sized syringe for your prescribed dose of Epidiolex. Epidiolex is prescribed in doses of milligrams (mg) of medication per kilogram (kg) of body weight. One kilogram of body weight is equal to 2. 2 pounds of body weight. Your dosage will be written as mg/kg. Recommended (standard) dosages for people with seizures caused by Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome are listed below. Starting dosage: 2. 5 mg/kg taken by mouth twice daily, Maintenance dosage: 5 mg/kg taken by mouth twice daily, Maximum dosage: 10 mg/kg taken by mouth twice daily. Your doctor may increase your dosage after you or your child takes the starting dose for one week. Dosages are increased depending on how well the drug is tolerated and if it’s working well. Your doctor may prescribe a different dosage depending on several factors, including whether you have liver disease. If you have questions about the dosage that’s right for you, talk with your doctorIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it’s almost time for your next dose, skip your missed dose. Just take your next dose at the regular time. If you are not sure about whether you should take a missed dose, call your doctor’s office. Don’t take more than one dose of Epidiolex at the same time. Doing this can increase your risk of serious side effects. Epidiolex is meant to be used as a long-term treatment. If you and your doctor determine that Epidiolex seems to be safe and effective, you or your child will likely take it long term. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves prescription drugs such as Epidiolex to treat certain conditions. Epidiolex may also be used off-label for other conditions. Off-label use is when a drug that’s approved to treat one condition is used to treat a different condition. Epidiolex is FDA-approved to treat seizures caused by two rare and severe forms of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It causes seizures that usually begin in early childhood or infancy. Dravet syndrome. It causes seizures that usually begin in infancy. . These syndromes can be very difficult to treat. People with these forms of epilepsy often need more than one medication to reduce the number of seizures they have. Epidiolex is approved for use in adults and children ages 2 and older with these conditions. Epidiolex is the first FDA-approved drug made with cannabidiol (CBD). It’s only approved to treat seizures caused by Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Many studies are looking at other ways CBD could be used for medical treatment. Some of these possible uses are described below. Epidiolex for painEpidiolex isn’t approved to treat pain. Animal studies have shown that CBD may help relieve pain. However, fewer studies have looked at the safety and effectiveness of CBD for treating pain in humans. For more information, see the “ Epidiolex for treating pain ” section below. Epidiolex for anxietyEpidiolex isn’t approved to treat anxiety. However, several studies have shown that CBD may improve anxiety by reducing anxious feelings during stressful times. Epidiolex hasn’t been proven safe or effective for treating anxiety. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor. Epidiolex for autismEpidiolex isn’t approved to treat autism. Only a few studies have looked at using CBD to treat autism. In one clinical study of children with autism, CBD reduced symptoms of: aggression, anxiety, hyperactivity. Epidiolex hasn’t been proven safe or effective for treating autism. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor. Epidiolex for schizophreniaEpidiolex isn’t approved to treat schizophrenia. In several small studies, CBD reduced schizophrenia symptoms in some people. However, other studies haven’t shown an improvement in symptoms after treatment with CBD. Epidiolex hasn’t been proven safe or effective for treating schizophrenia. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor. Epidiolex for migraineEpidiolex is not approved to treat or prevent migraine. Few studies have looked at the use of CBD for migraine treatment. In some clinical studies, CBD helped to reduce the number of migraine headaches in people using the drug. In these studies, CBD was used in combination with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Similar to CBD, THC is a compound that comes from marijuana. THC can cause you to feel “ high ” or euphoric. These effects aren’t caused by CBD. Epidiolex hasn’t been proven safe or effective for treating migraine. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor. Epidiolex for infantile spasmsEpidiolex isn’t approved to treat infantile spasms. Only one small clinical study looked at using CBD to treat this condition. For almost all of the infants in the study, CBD didn’t improve their symptoms. Epidiolex hasn’t been proven safe or effective for treating infantile spasms. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor. Epidiolex for tuberous sclerosisEpidiolex isn’t approved to treat tuberous sclerosis. However, in one small clinical study, the following results were seen in people with this condition: those who took CBD had almost 50% fewer seizures after three months of treatment, about half of those taking CBD had 50% fewer seizures after one year of treatment. People in this study taking CBD in combination with a seizure drug called clobazam had even fewer seizures during treatment. Epidiolex hasn’t been proven safe or effective for treating tuberous sclerosis. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor. Epidiolex for multiple sclerosisEpidiolex isn’t approved to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). There isn’t much known about using CBD alone to treat MS. Several studies have looked at using a combination of CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to treat MS. Similar to CBD, THC comes from marijuana. However, THC can cause you to feel “ high ” or euphoric. These side effects aren’t caused by CBD. In studies of people with MS taking CBD and THC, some symptoms improved during treatment. Symptoms that improved included: muscle spasticity (stiff or contracting muscles), urinary incontinence (loss of urinary control), generalized pain. Epidiolex hasn’t been proven safe or effective for treating MS. Only use Epidiolex as directed by your doctor. Epidiolex is FDA-approved for use in children to treat seizures caused by Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. It can be given to children ages 2 years and older. Epidiolex isn’t FDA-approved to treat pain. Epidiolex is made from cannabidiol (CBD). This compound is a drug that comes from marijuana (cannabis). CBD has been studied as a treatment for pain in both animals and humans. The exact way that CBD reduces pain isn’t known. It’s thought that CBD blocks certain pain signals traveling through the body’s nerves. This may help to reduce the pain you actually feel. CBD also helps to stop inflammation that can happen after nerves are irritated by pain. Several animal studies have looked at using CBD to treat pain. In these studies, CBD reduced pain in animals that had nerve pain caused by chemotherapy (a type of cancer treatment) or joint pain caused by arthritis. One small study looked at using CBD to treat people with pain caused by nerve disease or nerve damage. People in this study were given either CBD, THC (a drug that also comes from cannabis), CBD together with THC, or a placebo (no treatment). The results showed the following: those who took CBD alone had less pain each day than people taking the placebo, those who took CBD in combination with THC had fewer muscle spasms and better sleep than people taking CBD alone or people taking the placebo (there were no significant results in this group showing a reduced pain level). Many other studies have found that the combination of CBD and THC helps to reduce pain caused by some diseases and injuries. More research is needed to know if CBD treatment alone reduces pain. Epidiolex is FDA-approved to treat seizures caused by two forms of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. These rare but severe conditions usually appear in early childhood or infancy. Before Epidiolex was approved, it was tested in clinical trials. Its active ingredient, cannabidiol, is currently being tested in clinical trials for other uses. In clinical trials, people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who were treated with Epidiolex had fewer seizures than people who did not take the drug. During the 14-week study: people who took 20 mg/kg of Epidiolex daily had up to 25% fewer seizures, people who took 10 mg/kg of Epidiolex daily had 20% fewer seizures. Another clinical trial lasting 14 weeks looked at people with Dravet syndrome. This trial included children and teenagers. People who took Epidiolex had 26% fewer seizures than people who did not take the drug. The dosage of Epidiolex given in this trial was 20 mg/kg daily. All of the people in both of these clinical trials were taking Epidiolex in combination with other epilepsy drugs. Examples of epilepsy medications given include: clobazam (Onfi, Sympazam), valproate (Depacon), levetiracetam (Keppra, Roweepra), lamotrigine (Lamictal), topiramate (Topamax, Trokendi XR), stiripentol (Diacomit), rufinamide (Banzel). Cannabidiol (the active drug in Epidiolex) is currently being tested in clinical trials as a treatment option for other conditions. Research is being done for the following conditions: anxiety, bipolar depression, alcohol use disorder in people with post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, psoriatic arthritis. Many ongoing studies for other conditions are also being done. If you’d like to participate in a study, look for clinical trials in your area at clinicaltrials. gov. Other drugs are available that can treat your condition. Some may be better suited for you than others. If you’re interested in finding an alternative to Epidiolex, talk to your doctor to learn more about other medications that may work well for you. Note: Some of the drugs listed here are used off-label to treat these specific conditions. Treatment guidelines recommend the following drugs to treat Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: valproate/valproic acid (Depacon, Depakene), lamotrigine (Lamictal), topiramate (Topamax, Trokendi XR, Qudexy XR), clobazam (Onfi, Sympazan), rufinamide (Banzel), felbamate (Felbatol). Some experts recommend the following drugs to treat Dravet syndrome: valproate/valproic acid (Depacon, Depakene), clobazam (Onfi, Sympazan), stiripentol (Diacomit), topiramate (Topamax, Trokendi XR, Qudexy XR), clonazepam (Klonopin), levetiracetam (Keppra, Roweepra, Spritam), zonisamide (Zonegran). Epidiolex is commonly prescribed with other drugs when used to treat seizures. Many of the drugs listed above can be used in combination with Epidiolex. Your doctor will recommend which drugs can be used together based on your condition. Epidiolex is FDA-approved to treat seizures caused by two forms of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. It’s the only drug containing cannabidiol (CBD) that’s approved for medical use by the FDA. The quality, safety, and effectiveness of a drug can be ensured by FDA-approval. Because Epidiolex has been approved by the FDA, you can be assured that the drug: contains the exact amount of CBD that the manufacturer says it does, is proven safe to treat certain seizure disorders, is effective to treat certain seizure disorders. Other products made with CBD are available to purchase, but they haven’t been approved by the FDA. This means that the FDA can’t guarantee that those products have a safe amount of CBD. It also means the effectiveness of those products hasn’t been tested. One study looked at products containing CBD that were not FDA-approved. The study found that only 31% of those products contained the amount of CBD listed on their label. Of the remaining 69% of products: 43% had more CBD than the label stated, 26% had less CBD than the label stated. The labels for these products didn’t state that they contained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). However, about 21% of the products did contain THC. This chemical is found in marijuana (cannabis). THC can make you feel “ high ” or euphoric. Certain US. states have laws that require products containing CBD to be tested before they’re sold. States that haven’t made marijuana (cannabis) legal for medical or recreational use don’t have these laws. This means that products containing CBD might not be tested before they’re sold in some areas of the United States. Be sure you’re familiar with state laws before you purchase any products containing CBD. This will help you make sure that you buy products from safe and reputable companies that have had their products tested. You may wonder how Epidiolex compares to other products made from cannabis. Here we look at how Epidiolex and Charlotte’s Web are alike and different. Epidiolex contains the drug cannabidiol (CBD). This drug comes from marijuana (cannabis). CBD doesn’t make you feel “ high ” or euphoric. Charlotte’s Web refers to many different products that contain chemicals from hemp plants. These drugs could include CBD and small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). You can feel “ high ” or euphoric after using THC. Charlotte’s Web may also contain other chemicals depending on the type of product and where it is purchased. It’s not known if these other chemicals are safe for use in people. Epidiolex is FDA-approved to treat seizures caused by two forms of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. These rare but severe conditions usually appear in early childhood or infancy. Epidiolex can be used to treat adults and children ages 2 years and older. Charlotte’s Web products are not FDA-approved to treat medical conditions. By law, makers of Charlotte’s Web can’t claim that the product treats or cures any disease. Charlotte’s Web products are sometimes used to help support health and well-being. Some people use these products to help increase calmness, improve focus, or reduce stress. It’s important to remember that the safety and effectiveness of Charlotte’s Web have not been proven. Epidiolex comes as a strawberry-flavored liquid solution. It contains 100 mg of CBD per milliliter (mL) of solution. Epidiolex is taken by mouth twice daily. Charlotte’s Web products are available as oral capsules, oils, creams, and balms. Products come in many different doses, ranging from 6 mg to 60 mg of CBD per mL of product. Epidiolex is an FDA-approved drug. This means that side effects caused by Epidiolex have been reported in clinical studies. It also means that Epidiolex has been proven safe and effective to treat certain conditions. Charlotte’s Web products haven’t been studied in clinical trials. Side effects of Charlotte’s Web haven’t been reported and aren’t known for sure. Because of this, it’s not possible to compare the side effects of Epidiolex and Charlotte’s Web. Charlotte’s Web hasn’t been studied in clinical trials. Because of this, it’s not possible to compare the effectiveness of Charlotte’s Web to the effectiveness of Epidiolex. Epidiolex is a brand-name drug. There are currently no generic forms available. Brand-name medications usually cost more than generics. To find out about cost for Epidiolex in your area, visit WellRx. com. Charlotte’s Web is available as a variety of products.

The actual price you’ll pay for any drug will depend on your insurance plan, your location, and the pharmacy you use. Epidiolex and alcohol don’t interact with each other. But they can both cause similar effects in your body, including: drowsiness, sleepiness, loss of coordination, trouble thinking clearly. Drinking alcohol while taking Epidiolex can worsen these side effects. To reduce your risk of having these effects, you should avoid drinking alcohol while using Epidiolex. If you have trouble avoiding alcohol, talk with your doctor. Epidiolex can interact with several other medications. It can also interact with certain supplements as well as certain foods. Different interactions can cause different effects. For instance, some can interfere with how well a drug works, while others can cause increased side effects. Below is a list of medications that can interact with Epidiolex. This list does not contain all drugs that may interact with Epidiolex. Before taking Epidiolex, be sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about all prescription, over-the-counter, and other drugs you take. Also tell them about any vitamins, herbs, and supplements you use. Sharing this information can help you avoid potential interactions. If you have questions about drug interactions that may affect you, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Certain seizure medicationsTaking Epidiolex with certain seizure medications can increase the risk of side effects and change how the medications work. Some examples of interactions with seizure medications include: Clobazam (Onfi, Sympazan). Taking Epidiolex with clobazam can increase blood levels of clobazam.

The following information is provided for clinicians and other healthcare professionals. Epidiolex (cannabidiol) is FDA-approved for the following indications: treatment of seizures due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, treatment of seizures due to Dravet syndrome. It is approved for use in people ages 2 years and older. The mechanism of action of Epidiolex in treating epilepsy is not clear. However, it appears that the anticonvulsant activity of Epidiolex is not related to interaction with cannabinoid receptors in the body. At steady state, Epidiolex reaches maximum concentration in 2. 5 to 5 hours. High-calorie or high-fat meals increase maximum concentration 5-fold, compared to concentration after administration in a fasted state. Protein binding of the parent drug and metabolites is greater than 94%. Epidiolex is extensively metabolized by the liver. Metabolism occurs via CYP2C19, CYP3A4, UGT1A7, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment increases blood plasma levels 2. 5-fold to 5. 2-fold. The half-life of Epidiolex is between 56 and 61 hours. Elimination occurs primarily in the feces, with significantly less excretion in the urine. Epidiolex is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cannabidiol or any of the components of Epidiolex. Epidiolex is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sesame seed oil. Epidiolex is classified by the federal government as a schedule five (V) drug, which has the lowest abuse and addiction potential compared to other drug schedules. In clinical studies, there were no reports of abuse or dependence. As with all anti-epileptic drugs, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided due to potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. Gradual titration is recommended. Store Epidiolex in an upright position and at room temperature (68°F to 78°F, or 20°C to 25. 6°C) with the cap tightly closed. Do not freeze. Discard any unused solution 12 weeks after first opening.
