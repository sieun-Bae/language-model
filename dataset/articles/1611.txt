The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating a varied diet comprising many vegetables, fruits, and whole-grains as well as legumes, nuts, and lean meats. People should aim to include orange, red, and green foods that contain the carotenoids lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and provitamin A in their diet. Carotenoids are very important for immune function, and occur in the following foods: orange foods: carrot, pumpkin, and apricot, red foods: watermelon, red pepper, grapefruit, and cherry, green foods: kale, parsley, spinach, melon, lettuce, and endive. Limiting trans and saturated fats, and avoiding added sugar and salt where possible can also reduce inflammation and improve immune function. Healthy individuals should not need to take supplements. However, individuals who are immune-compromised and over the age of 50 should consider supplementation to maintain good health and strong immunity. There is a link between vitamin D and immune function. Many older people are at risk of low vitamin D levels, so they must ensure that they get sufficient sun exposure or take supplements to protect their immunity. Taking vitamin C, zinc, and selenium supplements can also improve immunity in older adults. However, taking high doses of vitamins and minerals can do more harm than good. Multivitamins, which contain lower and safer levels of many vitamins and minerals, are usually a better option. Smoking offers no health benefits and is always harmful. It is vital to quit smoking as it increases the risk of many cancers and diseases. Smoking lowers immunity against infection, especially in older people, and can delay recovery and healing.
